# Project developed for Bootcamp Driven Education

## Globo.com main page layout with html and css.

#### Requirements for the project:

- [ ] Apply the layout following the provided Figma;
- [ ] Use Encode Sans font on the page. Since it's not a standard font on computers, you'll have to import it into the page;
- [ ] All news must be links. It is not necessary to put links to the real pages, it can be a fake *link* (ex: `https://globo.com`);
- [ ] To make images with rounded edges look for the `border-radius` property.

#### There was a bonus challenge to make the page adapt to lower resolution screens without affecting the desktop view.
I implemented the layout for 370 x 600 resolution.

#### Requirements for the project:

- [ ] The logo must change to the *mobile* logo;
- [ ] The navigation menu must be under the logo;
- [ ] The news must be stacked, as shown in the *mobile layout*.
